        My name is Nattha Sritana-anant. I’m a career switcher into tech with an
        engineering background and recent training from Generation’s Junior
        Software Developer Bootcamp. I work with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and
        build frontend using React with responsive design. On the backend, I use
        Node.js and Express, and work with databases like SQL and MongoDB. I’m a
        fast learner, a strong team player, and eager to contribute to
        real-world software projects.
